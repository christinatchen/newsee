# newsee

Webapp concept that allows users to browse news stories written in the simplest language possible, and accompanied with contextual infographics and other resources for further understanding. This project was created for WHACK 2017, Wellesley College's hackathon, with three teammates.

# Demo 

[This](https://christinatchen.github.io/newsee/) is the static site. (Note: due to time constraints, interactivity was hardcoded for the demonstration. The main article, #MeToo article, and lifestyle sections are clickable, as well as navigating back to the home page by clicking the logo.)

Here is an example of an informational infographic created for the site:
